NOTICES:
- Extremely unfinished.
- Written rather informally and non-fancily until we find a style of writing that suits this.
- (There is also some more text elsewhere that is yet to be written in).

RULES:
- If there are non-jargon words or phrasing you find too obscure, replace them. This is supposed to be as easily told as possible, even at the expense of some accuracy and nuance. This book should be useable for a layman.
- Format: chapter - page - story
- Chapters are a scope of reality (e.g. history, society, individuals).
- Pages are a point which should preferably originate from some systematic logic, but that is difficult. So what the logic for each chapter would be, probably becomes more apparent as we write.
- Non-opening stories are in principle supposed to be amalgamations of stories and occurances common in human cultures. But given the limited nature of information, and how those stories might not cover everything relevant to us, take that more as inspiration, and just write from discretion for now.
- Each page has an opening story that explains it directly, and then gives a discrete amount of story-verses underneath as examples, answers to common questions, potential misinterpretations, and etc.

GUIDELINES:
- Nothing is "off the table", but of course needs to serve a holistically relevant purpose.
- Be bold. Given how mistakes are easy to correct if any are made, along with the possibility of moving stuff around later.
