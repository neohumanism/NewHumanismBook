You should read book 1 first.

NOTICES:
- Extremely unfinished.
- Written rather informally and non-fancily until we find a style of writing that suits this.

RULES:
- If there are non-jargon words or phrasing you find too obscure, replace them. This is supposed to be as easily told as possible, even at the expense of some accuracy and nuance. This book should be useable for a layman.
- Format: chapter - heading - paragraph
- Chapters are a scope of reality (e.g. history, society, individuals).
- Passages have an opening verse that explains it directly, and then gives a discrete amount of story-verses underneath as examples, answers to common questions, pitfalls, and etc.

GUIDELINES:
- Nothing is "off the table", but of course needs to serve a holistically relevant purpose.
- Be bold. Given how mistakes are easy to correct if any are made.
