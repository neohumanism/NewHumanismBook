we will need to make one of these about how human epistemology is necessarily from a human perspective and so on

also one that explains how reality works (from a human perspective) (via brahman and yahweh making reality or something funny like that)

{What happened in the past? Like a human can recall from days past with lower clarity for each, so does human society. What happened in the past may therefore not be known in much detail beyond what we can infer. That is why the tales we tell are not truly of specifics or individuals, but of lessons and humanity's whole.}
