# 2 The Human Circumstance

## The human plight is mortality, and the human struggle is to overcome it. 

#also that our fates are shared? #saying it is a struggle between sapience/order and chaos isnâ€™t wrong either, since we effectively want to make stability by making a complicated system, rather than a having a flat equilibrium happen

## Many Spiritual Roads

There was a warm wetland infested with disease. There, each others' touch would infect one another, and prompt death, whether from worms, men, or beasts. Through the lense of that air, the world was disgusting. They separated society into different groups to avoid contamination, and would cultivate spiritual pursuits far away from the contaminated soils, cultivating the spirit away from the worldly routines. Their spirits could only escape from the physical world through this cultivation, to be solved.

There was a serene woodland divided by mountains and waters. When one got sick there, it was rarely for long. When the winters came, it was only for a while, and the snow would melt. And when war came, the knights would clank their metals, and soon head home with few injuries. The world appeared amicable. So the spirit's journey to salvation must be so too. In fact, they found the world so agreeable, it appeared malleable. And they came to believe salvation was to be brought by their own hands on Earth.

There was a sea of sands with oases far inbetween. The everyday was but a long trek from oasis to oasis. Hence the spirit's journey to salvation must be too. On the way, one would be sparing and careful of food, ready to protect one's livestock, be wary of degeneration, and have faith there will be respite at the end of the wandering. So if one followed life like a journey through the desert, one would reach salvation.

There was a turbulent land under heaven. With cooperation, one could control the land for immense prosperity. And without, the land would be one's bane. Thus, all households gathered together, and conformed to specific codes of conduct to create cohesion. For when society was in harmony, the land was in harmony, and the path of the spirits would surely be stabilized for a journey as well.

Yet, through every different path, and in every region, no one were above death. It was thus that despite the different roads taken by the spirits, their end destination was always the realm of immortality.
