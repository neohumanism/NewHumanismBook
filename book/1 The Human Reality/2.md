# 2 The Struggle Against Mortality

## The universal human plight was mortality, and the struggle was to overcome it. 

#also that our fates are shared? #saying it is a struggle between sapience/order and chaos isnâ€™t wrong either, since we effectively want to make stability by making a complicated system, rather than a having a flat equilibrium happen

## Providence

Humans were lost until they found comfort in forces of providence beyond the knowable universe. While evidence for such any such forces would be non-existent, their practical effects on humans could not be denied. The struggle against death is grueling when everyone knows they will die one day, and only a distant generation may reach the goalpost. And so to deny faith in Providence would be to deny human hope.
