1 There is one truth of humankind that transcends time and space - It is universal. 





From the beginning of human history, there always were certain truths. These were expressed through human behaviors, collected over time as wisdom inherited by humanity, the human heritage. These truths were expressed differently in each region. Today however, the universal truth of humankind is revealed. It should come naturally as a formulation of their intuitive thoughts, and be the formulation that unifies all regional expressions. #our explicit epistemology? #the universal human truth is also intuitive?

"No, this thing is hard like a spear!", cried the one gripping its tusks. "No, it is clearly like a fan!", said the man touching its ear. And the trunk was a snake, the body a wall, and the tail a feather. And they then kept arguing, convinced that they were right and that everyone else had to be hallucinating.}
