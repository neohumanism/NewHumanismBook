It should come naturally as a formulation of their intuitive thoughts, and be the formulation that unifies all regional expressions. #our explicit epistemology? #the universal human truth is also intuitive?

"No, this thing is hard like a spear!", cried the one gripping its tusks. "No, it is clearly like a fan!", said the man touching its ear. And the trunk was a snake, the body a wall, and the tail a feather. And they then kept arguing, convinced that they were right and that everyone else had to be hallucinating.}
