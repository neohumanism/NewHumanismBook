## 1 The Universal Truth of Humankind

There is one truth of humankind that transcends time and space. 

From the beginning of human history, there always were certain truths to human behavior. That is a certainty due to humans having patterns, much like all things in the universe. And by looking at the breadth and different periods of human history, the universal truths can be discerned from all the regional and temporal differences. Thus, the human heritage may be revealed.

And it is the case today, with our unparalleled abiltiy to peer into the past and every culture across the world, that we may construct the most accurate version of this universal truth. So it is today all variant expressions may be unified under one general formulation that is intuitive to all.

## The blind men and the elephant

Several blind men approach an elephant. Each of them touch a part of it, and try to describe it, to figure out what it is. "It is stout like a tree!", said the man pushing its legs. "No, this thing is hard like a spear!", shouted the one gripping its tusks. "No, it is clearly like a fan!", cried the man touching its ear. And likewise, the trunk was a snake, the body a wall, and the tail a feather. And they then kept arguing, convinced that they were right and that everyone else had to be stupid or misguided.

## Perception of shadows from a fire

//How can there be one truth if there are many correct variants of it? That is because none of them are entirely correct, by being abstractions of the same fundament. That fundament, they never knew of by more than intuition, and is the one truth.
//we may not perceive the truth directly, and must abstract it, so of course the regional variations of the truth are not the same
