Practices like firecontrol, sowing, and herding were discovered and adopted.

{The tribes learnt to sow. The blue tribe had good harvests, and thought they would never starve again. They stored it so that they could eat it when their harvests were poor. But the red tribe was optimistic, had many children, and fed them their harvests. So when the rains stopped and both tribes' harvests shriveled, the red tribe grew desperate, and overwhelmed the blue tribe with superior numbers. Then, the red tribe took their food. So from there on, the tribes did not store much food, and instead grew children to kill each other. And any tribe that wanted to stop, would only live under the heel of another. The tribes had gained nothing against starvation.}
