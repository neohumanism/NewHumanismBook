# 4 The Price of Progress

## A struggle begun.

On days by chance however, humans would stumble upon new ways to exploit the environment they lived in. Which they thought would improve their lives. Practices like firecontrol, sowing, and herding were discovered and adopted. But these new ways rarely changed their lives for the better, as human nature would have them squander the gains, even making life worse. And they could not be undone.

## The Creation of War

The tribes learnt to sow. The blue tribe had good harvests, and thought they would never starve again. They stored it so that they could eat it when their harvests were poor. But the red tribe was optimistic, had many children, and fed them their harvests. So when the rains stopped and both tribes' harvests shriveled, the red tribe grew desperate, and overwhelmed the blue tribe with superior numbers. Then, the red tribe took their food. So from there on, the tribes did not store much food, and instead grew children to kill each other. And any tribe that wanted to stop, would only live under the heel of another. The tribes had gained nothing against starvation.
