# 5 Realization of The Future

## Our destiny awaits.

Humans had not yet realized what they had done, and thought of their new ways as curses they could not get rid of. But they eventually came to understand that they were not truly voluntary transgressions, but inevitabilities of human curiosity and vigor. And that their salvation would come the day they attain the power to overcome nature. Or else, nature would one day, by one too many whims, rid itself of them. Thenceforth, humanity understood they were to use their new ways to solve the mortal plight and conquer nature. This was the beginning of the human will for worldly change, the realization of progress.

## Conquering The Elements

The humans thirsted once more, but the weather spirits did not respond. The first time, they dug into the ground and found a well of water. The second time, they built dams on the rivers. The third time, they melted the glaciers. And the fourth time, they drank the oceans with the salt left behind. And when they would master the elements fully, they would no longer need the spirits.

## Forth is The Only Path

Humans stepped forwards and heard: "There is nothing but your shared fate. And that walks with you. There is nothing behind you.". The ones who looked back turned into minerals.
