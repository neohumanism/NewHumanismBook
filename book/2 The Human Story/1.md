# 1 Callous Nature

## Nature is as much a friend as an enemy.

In the universe, there was nature and dust. From the dust, nature made a landscape. And in that landscape, nature made life, among it, the animals. The animals were mortal; prone to suffering and dying. Nature was not forgiving, so most of their kinds would regularly go extinct. Whether due to a whim or an inbuilt flaw. And nature remained indifferent.

## Nature's favor

Sometimes, a creature was favored over others, but never for long. First, came the plants. They had clear skies to feed on. But they were made to breathe frost, and could do nothing to stop it. They blotted the skies with snow, strangling themselves to death, along with most other life. Then came the fish. There was much food in the water, and they prospered. But one day, on a whim, the volcanoes erupted, blotting the skies with smoke and souring the waters, strangling them to death, along with most other life. Then came the reptiles. The land was opened for them. But on another whim, a giant rock impacted the earth, blotting the skies with ash, strangling them to death, along with most other life. Then came the mammals.
