2 The spark of mind. One mammal distinguished themselves, the humans. Like the others, was their capacity to feel, spot, move, and strike. Though their capacities for which were poor in comparison. Rather, their specialty rested in their heads, and was their spark of mind. With which, they could question and assemble patterns of what they knew, allowing them to gather wisdom to make conscious decisions. It granted them the freedom to understand reality.

{In the forest paradise, were the progenitors. They lived there among other apes, in the treetops away from the feathered lizards. These peaceful days lasted until there were more apes than trees, and a fight broke out to occupy the forest. There, the progenitors, as the runts of the litter, could not outmaneuver or wrestle against the other apes. They lost, and were banished from the forest. From there on, they had to wander the savanna.}
{The progenitors roamed the savanna in fear of the feathered lizards. One day, they heard the feathered lizards approaching. But they found nowhere to hide. Instead, they found a fruit (or a mushroom). The fruit promised they would become masters of the world, should they be willing to curse their blood with eternal suffering. In choosing between suffering and death, they promptly bit it, and it brought them forbidden insight. With this heightened awareness, they now saw the sharp stones, long sticks, and grassy fibers around them. They fashioned them into spears and traps, which they used to slay the feathered lizards. Then on the feathered lizards' corpses, they stood as the new masters of the world. All owing to this greater awareness, above any other animal. And so the progenitors proclaimed themselves the "the wise ones", becoming the humans.}
