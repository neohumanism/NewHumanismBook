## Synopsis – Contents

The human goal across history was to struggle against death and suffering. Whether by action or hope. That would foreseeably have continued, was it not for recent technological developments. The technology on the horizon appears powerful, perhaps enough to end scarcity and decay – to solve our mortality. Yet, that power, may just as well be used to destroy ourselves or bring untold suffering, which with our flawed natures in mind, is alarming. And now, by wielding this unprecedented power, we are approaching this crossroads – the end of history as we know it. Is this true, and what should we do?

## Foreword – Method

We live in a tumultuous time, one requiring immense cohesion and understanding to accomplish what is needed for survival. Meaning our efforts cannot afford to be misguided, and we have little room to learn from failures. Hence, it is important we prepare ourselves to the utmost possible. However, this effort at making the book thorough, also makes it quite abstract from common human ways of viewing the world. And so, if you find this book incomprehensible, you are implored to read the second one instead (sc. that one tells most of everything here but in story-form with willful creatures).
