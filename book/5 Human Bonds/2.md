A goat wandered into a barren plot grazed by a flock of sheep. The goat approached one of the sheep, and asked why the plot was barren. The conversation was picked up by other sheep, who thought the goat said he had eaten the plot barren. Then, this news spread throughout the flock, and the flock approached the goat and sheep talking. They asked the goat why he had eaten the plot barren. The goat was confused, and asked the previous taking sheep what this was about, only for that one to turn against him as well. And so, the flock drove the goat away, and hoped that would make the grass regrow.
